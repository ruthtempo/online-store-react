Online Shop with full user-flow Simulation

I used [Fakestore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to get the product database. Although there are not many products, it was enough to do the job and get an idea of the shop looks.

**Functionalities:**

* Register and Login
* Add to Cart / Remove from Cart
* Add to Favorites ( you need to be logged in in order to be able to do so) / Remove from favorites

Note: When the user logs out, the favorites get save in the localStorage, so that when the user logs back in, the favorites are not lost. 

**Stack**

- React, Typescript
- React-Bootstrap
- Animate.css
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
